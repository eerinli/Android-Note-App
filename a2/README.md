    ## Setup
    * macOS 12.2.1
    * IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1 (Community Edition)
    * kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
    * Java SDK 17.0.2 (temurin)
 
    ## Enhancement 
    I added more statistical information to the visualization: 
    * standard deviatio(SD), max, min, sum, and median are added in both bar chart 
    * additional lines for median and SD is added in the third visualization to avoid confusion
    * median is represented by blue line and SD is represented by green line

    I allowed two data set to be rendered in visualization of line chart: 
    * click the second "data set selector" to select the second dataset where "" is the default selection
    * dataset 2 values is updated in data entries on the left and also in the visualization
    * dataset 2 is represented by blue line with green marker
    * change the value of an entry in the dataset 2 entry updates the visualization accordingly
    * Note: you could only change the value in the entry of dataset 2 but not add / delete
    * choose the null selection "" to render only dataset 1 in line chart

    I allowed more color selection in the visualization: 
    * slide the "Saturation" slider in data entry below the "Add Entry" button changes the saturation of visualization
    * slide the "Brightness" slider in data entry changes the brightness of visualization
    * The value of saturation and brightness is shown on the right of the sliders
    * Note: The slider changes do not apply to line chart

    ## Bonus
    * Bonus is all implemented as described
